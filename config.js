    text: `
        <p>Hi there, I am Liesa, a twenty-something girl living in Berlin. I’m a content creator, a social media and PR manager and a blogger. My natural curiosity helps me to always be on top of the latest social media trends, new tools and marketing techniques.</p>

        <p>I’m a strong believer in living and learning. In my opinion that’s what furthers out of the box thinking and eventually makes you an expert in your field.</p>

        <p>I think that expertise derives from two things mainly: ambition and passion. Both are characteristics that describe me very well. I just love what I do and that’s what makes it easy to always learn more, do more and get better and better.</p>

        <p>By the way, I am a <strong>German</strong> native speaker but also comfortable in <strong>English</strong>.</p>
