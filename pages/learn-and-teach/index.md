I like to keep my brain active and myself busy. That's why I love learning new things, e.g. JavaScript on <BlogLink to="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</BlogLink> or languages such as French, Italian or Portuguese on <BlogLink to="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</BlogLink>.

I am also writing my personal Fitness Blog <BlogLink to="https://www.21moves.com/">21moves</BlogLink> where I provide quality content and <BlogLink to="https://www.wayfaringsociety.com">The Wayfaring Society</BlogLink> where I teach about  Marketing and digital nomadism.
